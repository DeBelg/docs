## Details of types

### Meetup

A meetup is a shorter type of event for 2-6 hours (usually afternoon/evening).

The number of slots at a meetup is usually 3-5.

### Summit

The Summit is an all-day event, usually followed by an afterparty.

Summit is usually made up of 10-16 slots.

### Hackathon

A hackathon is usually a multi-day event focused on creation. What makes it different from other types is that it should end with some work being done, whether it's some privacy-focused projects or pushing our own projects forward.

A Hackathon is usually accompanied by one or more Meetups, or possibly a Summit.

The number of slots at the hackathon is very flexible.

### Meta-hackathon

The meta-hackathon is a multi-day event focused purely on building and expanding Web3Privacy Now activities.
