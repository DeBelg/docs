Over the past two years, we have experimented with various governance models. 

Below, we share our findings, highlighting missteps to serve as inspiration for others.

## Current Governance System:

Anyone who assists in the completion of our projects is considered a contributor. Frequent contributors have the chance to become [Core Contributors](https://docs.web3privacy.info/core-contributors/) and receive rewards for their contributions to open source.

### Proof of Care

The transition from contributors to [Core Contributors](https://docs.web3privacy.info/core-contributors/) occurs through a Proof of Care: through continuous or substantial involvement, contributors demonstrate their interest and dedication to our mission. 

By completing various contributions for the benefit of the ecosystem, the core team will certify a proof of care and reward core contributors for their contributions to open source. 

### Proof of Soul

To join the [Core Team](https://docs.web3privacy.info/core-team/), a Proof of Soul is required. Through closer interaction with the core team, the most active core contributors who are committed to supporting the organization's values and advancing its mission can gradually become part of the decision-making process as they earn the credibility and trust of all core team members.
