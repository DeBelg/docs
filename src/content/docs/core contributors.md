title: Core Contributors
---

A collective of frequent and reliable contributors to Web3Privacy Now who receive financial incentives.


## Purpose

Reward those who contribute on an ongoing basis and whose work has had a considerable impact 

## Income

We don't want to give ourselves paychecks, nor do we want to make a complicated system of paying by hourly rates or tasks completed, so we choose a simpler route inspired by our interest and mission to have a practical impact.

Any contribution that has a practical impact on the ecosystem (e.g. completing and publishing a search, updating our DB or filling an entire explorer category, selecting and curating educational content for the publication of a new course for our academy) will be rewarded on the basis of the impact it will have.

- little impact 100/300 eur
- good impact 400/700 eur
- high impact 800/1200 eur

## Rules

In order to become a core contributor, it is necessary to have already contributed to our projects on an ongoing basis, to have cultivated a direct relationship with at least one of the core team and to be willing to carry out one or more projects, or at least part of them on a more or less continuous basis.
