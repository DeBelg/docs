If you need some money for paying expenses of your privacy-related project, then we can help you with that too.

We are developing a transparent grant system that will serve as the main way to redistribute the majority of our income to (our) projects.

## Scope of funding

* cost of equipment and necessary tools
* operating costs
* marketing and promotional expenses

The subject of the funding request cannot be the direct payment of contributors - for these purposes it is necessary to become an active [Contributors to the project](/contributors/index).

## Funding Requests

*Funding Request Proposals* (FRPs) is a transparent application process to receive money from our [Treasury](/governance/treasury). Most of our income is redistributed through these applications.

Each application will be assessed by members of the [Core Team](/core-team), according to whose decision it will be accepted or rejected.

All funding requests are handled through Issues in the [`@web3privacy/funding`](https://github.com/web3privacy/funding) repository.

### Proposal requirements
* the amount required
* the purpose for which the funds will be used
* the person or group of people responsible
