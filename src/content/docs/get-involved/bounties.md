title: Bounties
---

## Concept
We give back to community by envolving skillful members into projects in need of stable delivery (with deadlines, scope of work, & financial compensation).
Bounties help us to
- scale core team impact
- speed up delivery
- expand ecosystem growth
- prove that we give back to loyal community

## How it works
There's neverending flow of internal needs beyond core team.
Approach: 
- on the weekly basis core team decides work to be outsourced to community
- performs 1on1 with proven contributors (through github, offline events, growth in socials)
- expand search beyond current contributors (if needed) through socials (open calls)
- disscuss timings, commitments & compensation (1on1)
- launch delivery via chat &/or micro-group (Signal, TG)
