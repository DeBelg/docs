title: Benefits for Organizations
---

## Rather than one-time deals for single events or projects, we strive for long-term, consistent collaboration to achieve a lasting impact together.

### Our Membership model has been designed to:

- Avoid wasting time and resources
- Foster collaboration with the aim of both organizations meeting their needs through collective action
- Leverage our combined ecosystems and activities

### Our Principles:

- We are an open-source & community-driven organization that empowers privacy and freedom.
- We care about our independence and value collaboration over competition.
- The last decision is always on us: we don’t work for any company, we collaborate with them.
- Ideal partners are those who champion the growth of privacy for all.
