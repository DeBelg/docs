## Who is a contributor?

A *contributor* is anyone who helps us with the realization of our [Projects](#projects).

Contributors are often grouped by their skills and interest in different Workgroups. 

Frequent contributors have the opportunity to become [Core Contributors](https://docs.web3privacy.info/core-contributors/) and be rewarded for their contributions to open source.

## Projects

*Project* is the basic unit of work by which we coordinate ourselves. 

An example of a project is [Research](/research) or [Events](/events) or [Privacy Explorer](/projects/privacy-explorer). Each of these top-level projects is a separate unit with its own autonomy and may have other sub-projects (such as a specific event or specific research report, etc.).

Check our [Projects registry](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/12)

⎆ How to update data in our Privacy Market DB

example: _Maintaining our privacy DB updated: PR at GitHub_

**Actualization**
_goal_: up to date info in the database
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Pick up a category (from DeFi to Infrastructure)
3. Check:
- product-readiness (actual state: devnet, testnet, mainnet)
- team status (public, anon)
- github/docs-readiness (available/not)
- ecosystem
- token (yes/no/Coinmarketcap link).
4. Add missing data & make a PR.

**Categorisation**
_goal_: broader list of categories within the privacy market.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check ["other"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#Other) & ["dapps"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#dapps) categories.
3. Find sub-categories (min 3-4 projects per category). Examples: "marketplaces" or "data lakes".
4. Once a new sub-category has been found - create it & move those projects under it.

**Sunset**
_goal_: actual information on terminated or abandoned projects.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check sunset projects (Twitter &/or Discord activity, GitHub activity).
3. 6 months hiatus - mark them with an icon of the moon next to them.

**Category Accuracy**

_goal_: check Infrastructure, dApps, Other categories if projects really belong there (some projects misslead readers pretending to be infrastructure, for example)
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check projects' website, documentation.
3. Make observations if a projects belongs to particular category (infrastructure - providing broader protocol toolkit for different decentralised implementations).
4. If project nature differs from category where it exists - move it to the right category.
