## Who is a contributor?

A *contributor* is anyone who helps us with the realization of our [Projects](#projects).

Contributors are often grouped by their skills and interest in different Workgroups. 

Every frequent contributor has the opportunity to become a [Core Contributor](https://docs.web3privacy.info/core-contributors/) and receive personal financial compensation for their efforts.

## Projects

*Project* is the basic unit of work by which we coordinate ourselves. 

An example of a project is [Research](/research) or [Events](/events) or [Privacy Explorer](/projects/privacy-explorer). Each of these top-level projects is a separate unit with its own autonomy and may have other sub-projects (such as a specific event or specific research report, etc.).

Check our [Projects registry](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/12)

### How to join a project
