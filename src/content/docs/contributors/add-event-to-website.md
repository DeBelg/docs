## Preamble

The purpose of this Guide is to help you add a new event to [Web3PrivacyNow website](https://web3privacy.info) by committing to the /data repository and deploying the change via Github Pages.

It is important to understand the the website is managed by Astro and is created by the magic of code and it fetches automatically any changes to the /data repository where our events, speakers, and other data is held.

## Pre-requisites
