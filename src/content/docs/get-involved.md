## __You wish to become a contributor to the Web3Privacy Now Ecosystem?? Let’s make sure we are on the same page about what our work is all about.__

Despite the foundational role that privacy is meant to play in shaping Web3, genuinely impactful initiatives remain scarce. 

Many projects leverage the concept of privacy as a buzzword or for public relations advantage, rather than addressing tangible issues or enacting substantial changes at the infrastructural and transactional level.

Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals to take control of their digital privacy by:

+ building practical tools
+ spreading knowledge (research, infographics, guidelines, academy...)
+ cultivating solidarity by facilitating understanding and collaboration  
+ gathering diverse background, skills, and perspectives (from hacktivists to policymakers, from philosophers to founders...)

### We envision a world where privacy is a conscious, actively chosen lifestyle, accessible to everyone, everywhere. To achieve this, we focus less on talking and more on action.
